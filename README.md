# CursorHP  

The CursorHP mod draws your health in a ring around your crosshair.
It does more than just that though, it also shows skill and equipment cooldowns/charges, sheild, and barrier.

I will probably add more, feel free to suggest things to add.

This Github Repo contains the mod source.

This is the 3rd iteration of this mod, check out the others:

- TModLoader: https://github.com/FuzzyExpress/CursorHP
- Minecraft Forge: { unpublished }

Notes & issues:

- Config is only partially implemented.
- Only tested with Huntress, other character features will be missing.
- Might not work in multiplayer as a client only mod.
- Might cuase lag.
